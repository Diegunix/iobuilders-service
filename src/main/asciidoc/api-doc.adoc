= Introduction

[[overview]]
= Overview
[[overview-http-verbs]]
== HTTP verbs

|===
| Verb | Usage
| `OPTIONS`
| Used to list method of resource
| `GET`
| Used to retrieve a resource
| `POST`
| Used to create a new resource
| `PUT`
| Used to update an existing resource, full updates only
| `DELETE`
| Used to delete an existing resource
|===
[[overview-http-status-codes]]
== HTTP status codes
Person-service tries to adhere as closely as possible to standard HTTP and REST conventions in its use of HTTP status codes.
|===
| Status code | Usage
| `200 OK`
| Standard response for successful HTTP requests.
| The actual response will depend on the request method used.
| In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource.
| In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.
| `201 Created`
| The request has been fulfilled and resulted in a new resource being created.
| `204 No Content`
| The server successfully processed the request, but is not returning any content.
| `400 Bad Request`
| The server cannot or will not process the request due to something that is perceived to be a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing).
| `404 Not Found`
| The requested resource could not be found but may be available again in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.
